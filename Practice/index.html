        <h2 id="duncan">Duncan Nicknames</h2>
        <p>The OG, Duncy-Dunc, Monkey, Skunky, or for short Monk, Skunk, or Duncer-Monker. He's been lovingly
            called
            Dunkin Donuts and Duncan Hines.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We got Duncan from our friends, the Barkers, in January 2008 when he was 8 weeks old. He was soooo
            tiny- around 2 pounds and melted our hearts instantly! As a puppy, he had the cutest toasted
            marshmallow coloring on his ears and a brown spot on his back where his tail is attached. We called
            it his ‚Äúpoop stain‚Äù. He also had a heart shaped black nose. We've always loved his black eyeliner
            that made his eyes so cute!</p>
        <p>How did we pick his name? When Mike held him, Duncan would move around like he was ‚Äúdunkin and
            divin‚Äù, hence the name Duncan fit our puppy perfectly!</p>
        <p>He always had that independent and sometimes grouchy chihuahua disposition. When he wanted pets, he
            wanted them NOW!! If he didn't want pets, he'd let you know.</p>
        <p>Duncan is super smart- always has been intelligent. He is the only dog we've had that could figure
            out how to open doors and doggy gates by busting in or using his paws. He played fetch tirelessly
            with dad every day! He would also make sure to get loves and would push himself between Mike and me
            so
            he
            could get the
            the attention and affection.</p>
        <p>He would also use this method as trickery when his brothers came along. He'd push his way into us
            for affection and pets, so his brothers would drop the bone, treat or toy to come over for attention
            too, and then Duncan would swoop in to take the bone, treat, or toy over for himself. It worked like
            a charm!</p>
        <p>His favorite toy is called ‚Äúthe bug‚Äù that he had since being a puppy. Grandma gave this toy to him,
            and he loves it so much. ‚ÄúBug‚Äù has had a lot of surgeries over the years and although it no longer
            has much fur left, it is still Duncy's favorite.</p>
        <p>We knew Duncan was such a cool pup and deserved a brother to play with and keep him company. Plus he
            made us fall in love with chihuahuas and opened our hearts to adding more little doggies to our
            family!</p>

        <h2 id="bear">Bear's Nicknames </h2>
        <p>Bearcub, Bear-Bear, Bear-Square, Dingo, and Care Bear.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We took Duncan to pick out his brother in February 2008. We found a nice family in Yuba County that
            had
            puppies for sale. We loved Bear's brindle color. He was so chubby as a puppy, he had a double chin!
            He
            was
            also a bit smaller than Duncan, and Duncan, at about 4 pounds, immediately was obsessed with Bear
            (around 3
            pounds) and started playing and kicking Bears roly-poly puppy bootie.</p>
        <p>Bear was a bit scared and whiny, but we knew he could stand up to Duncan as needed. So home we went
            with
            puppy #2!</p>

        <p>How did we pick Bear's name? He was such a little chub that he reminded us of a squishy teddy bear,
            hence
            his name Bear. As he grew into a teenager pup, he grew out of his chub into our sleek athletic dog.
            Bear
            was
            the braun while Duncan was the brains of our dog family. Both pups had so much energy that we'd run
            with
            them every day, up to 10 miles in a day!</p>
        <p> Bear was the best cuddle buddy ever and contorted his body to mom's back in bed and kept her warm,
            and
            was
            always there to let dad pet him to help soothe him in the middle of the night if dad woke up.</p>

        <p>We took Duncan and Bear to puppy training. While Duncan was well behaved and immediately learned to
            sit
            and
            lay down, Bear decided he was a mamas boy and would whine and cry and only let mom attempt to train
            him
            in
            class, but mostly wanted to be held. Most classes he didn't listen and made messes on the floor. We
            were
            able to train him to sit at home but he didn't want to do the commands in from of others. During our
            last
            training class, the graduation, the other puppies in the class were distracted and not cooperating.
            When
            it
            was Bear's turn, the trainer asked to show a special trick Bear had learned, and he nailed the doggy
            high
            five‚Ä¶.twice‚Ä¶and on command!! His high five became his signature trick, and even developed into ‚Äúgive
            me
            ten‚Äù. It was ‚Äúpawfect‚Äù. üòä</p>

        <p>Duncan and Bear were the best howlers when dad would chant ‚Äúdoggy, doggy, doggy!!‚Äù They taught many
            friends'
            dogs how to howl too.</p>

        <p>Duncan and Bear went on several hikes with us, and trips to the ocean and mountains. One highly
            memorable
            trip was to Portuguese Beach in Bodega Bay, and both decided to ‚Äúmountain-billy goat‚Äù climb to the
            top
            of
            the steep bluff from the beach. Luckily they listened to us and we called to them and they scurried
            down
            and
            was immediately placed back on their leash. They loved chasing each other in the sand! Bear also
            discovered
            the cattle grazing at Dillon's Beach and jumped out of the truck and started to herd the cows. He
            also
            would
            flush the pheasants out of the bushes during our trail walks. He was definitely a chihuahua mix, but
            mixed
            with what? Our friend said a dingo!</p>

        <p>Bear was such a sweet and special boy and Duncan and Bear would play hard and fight like brothers do.
            One
            of
            the funniest moments that friends and family still talk about was Bear's <em>‚Äúextra affection‚Äù</em>
            for blankets, especially dad's Green Bay Packers blanket. Bear somehow always ‚Äúput on a blanket
            show‚Äù when dad had people over to watch the Packers games which resulted in gut-busting laughter!
        </p>

        <p>We lost Bear in May 2022 unexpectedly. We are so grateful for the 14+ years we had with him!! He was
            an
            amazing addition to our family and had a great life!!</p>


        <h2 id="brewster">Brewster NickBrnames</h2>
        <p>Brew-brew, Brew-crew, Little Bit, Lil' Guy, Wiggle-butt, Brucifer, Garfield, and Diva.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Brewster's ‚Äúgotcha day‚Äù was in March 2020, at the start and height of COVID. He was a rescue, found
            by
            our
            friends as a tiny puppy wandering on a busy street. He was estimated to be around 8 weeks old, and
            our
            friends knew exactly who to introduce this little bundle of male chihuahua-mix joy to. Mike framed
            it as
            ‚Äúwe're just going to meet this puppy‚Äù but one look at his cute corkscrew tail, followed by his
            nuzzling
            and
            falling asleep in our arms, we adopted him on the spot and were glad to have this shining ray of
            puppy
            love
            and fun energy during an unprecedented pandemic time of uncertainty and quarantine.</p>
        <p>We loved his tan coloring, and as coffee lovers, we tried out names such as Latte, Frappy, Cold
            Brew‚Ä¶and
            then
            his name Brewster came to be.</p>
        <p>He's the only dog we've known that hates going for walks. He'd much rather be a couch potato all day
            wrapped
            in warm fuzzy blankets. However he absolutely loves car rides, especially when dad takes him to Home
            Depot
            and Lowe's. Brewster walks proudly with dad into these stores and insists that people give him lots
            of
            attention and will demand being pet! How would anyone deny attention to such a cute pup that gets so
            excited
            meeting people that he wiggles his entire back end (which actually earned him his nickname of
            ‚Äúwiggle
            butt‚Äù!)</p>
        <p>Brewster has no interest in meeting other dogs, though. He truly thinks he's human.</p>
        <p>He loves to eat cheese- good cheese like Tilamook sharp cheddar to be exact, and will hold out on
            eating
            hand
            outs of chicken or turkey in case there may be some medium-well steak we're instead handing out
            soon.
            His
            adoration of good food and lack of interest in exercise earned him his nickname of Garfield, who
            resembles
            Brewster in cat form.</p>
        <p>He is also an alarm clock. Each night, at 10 'clock sharp, he jumps off the couch and looks at mom
            and
            dad as
            if to say ‚Äúit's time for bed!‚Äù (which is translation for ‚Äúit's time for Brewster's treat!‚Äù) Brewster
            proudly
            does tricks for treats, such as spin, shake, meerkat, and stand tall! He also won't let us forget
            his
            bedtime treat and will stand at the corner of the bed and let out one high pitched bark at a time,
            with
            5
            second pauses in between, until he gets his bedtime treat!</p>
        <p>He loves chewing on bull sticks and other chew toys and gnaws on the treats while on top of dad's
            legs in
            bed, which lulls daddy to sleep.</p>
        <p>One time while getting his nails trimmed by mom- which is not his favorite activity- daddy held him
            on
            his
            back and fed him treats to distract him from the pedicure. Brewster thought this was the best ever
            as
            dad
            chuckled and said ‚Äúlet me feed you more grapes, your highness‚Äù. It was the easiest nail clipping
            session
            that day!</p>
        <p>Brewster was our first dog we rescued, but let's be serious - <em> who rescued who?!?!!!</em></p>

        <h2 id="rocky">Rocky Nicknames</h2>
        <p>Rocky-Docky, Rocky-Dawg, Rock, Piebald, RockStar, Rocket, Rocky Balboa, Rock-a-doodle-doo</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Rocky's ‚Äúgotcha day‚Äù was in August 2022 from a rescue. He came from a Stockton shelter. He was about
            6
            months
            old and a bit anxious about leaving in the car with us to his furever home. Our nephew, Bryce,
            helped
            pick
            him out and suggested the idea for his name. We all decided we liked the name Rocky for different
            reasons-
            mom and dad connected his name to Rocky Balboa- coming from humble beginnings and overcoming
            challenges
            and
            becoming a champion. Young Bryce picked his name because it's the name of a rapper he listens to,
            lol.
            Over
            the first month with us, we watched him going from shy and unsure to outgoing and playful as his
            trust
            in us
            strengthened. We don't know what his early beginnings were, but we love that he's confident and
            comfortable
            now that he's found his furever family! He's an incredibly sweet boy!</p>

        <p>He's the doggiest-dog we've ever had. He fetches, loves walking, and rolls in disgusting stuff. He
            eats
            just
            about anything- he has literally eaten the piece of paper to our internet provider password. Yep-
            only
            Rocky
            knows the password now!
            He loves stuffed toys. He starts with the tag and rips those off first. Then he rips out the threads
            and
            takes out the stuffing and squeaker and distributes it throughout the house! His toys now mostly
            consist
            of
            bits and pieces of fuzzy material of what used to be recognizable as a toy and he still wants to
            play
            fetch
            with the small remnant of fuzzy material. He is also obsessed with playing with his brothers and
            cousin
            dogs! He plays hard and it's so entertaining that mom and dad turn off the tv and watch him and his
            brothers
            and cousins play. Award winning entertainment, for sure!</p>

        <p>Rocky is also quite clumsy. At least once a day, he banks off the couch or ottoman and falls back on
            the
            floor, or trips while going up the stairs. It happens so often that mom and dad yell out ‚ÄúRocky met
            his
            quota today!‚Äù and we all know that means he didn't stick his landing. It doesn't stop him or slow
            him
            down a
            bit. He's still very much a puppy! When he gets excited- such as waiting for a treat, getting ready
            to
            go
            for a walk, or wanting attention in general, he jumps up and gently bites mom's bootie. He does this
            to
            grandma every so often too. It's hilarious and he can even jump high enough to do it while following
            his
            human up the stairs.</p>

        <p>He also thinks it's funny to drag dirty socks all over the house. If dad misses the hamper, any of
            those
            clothes are also fair game! If there is a missing sock, it's highly likely that Rocky has moved one
            elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Dad likes to count his spots. There's lots of them and dad says he finds new ones each day. Mom says
            her
            favorite spot to pet on Rocky are his armpits because they are so soft. Rocky likes his pets and
            rubs,
            including his armpits!</p>

        <p>Rocky likes to sleep with mom and dad in bed. He doesn't have one certain place- he likes to roam
            all over
            and shares his cuddles with everyone! He also likes going for walks in the neighborhood and will
            stop to
            let
            the little kids pet him and is so sweet and gentle. He's been such a joy and wonderful addition to
            our
            family! Again‚Ä¶.who rescued who?!?!!</p>
