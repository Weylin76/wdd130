    <h2>Weylin Douglas</h2>
    <p>I am married with 3 kids: Bryce (22), Ethan (16), and Katelyn (12). I have been a member of The Church of Jesus
        Christ of Latter-Day Saints most of my life; I joined the church when I was in 7th grade. I grew up in
        California but moved to Michigan after I graduated from high school. I live near Lansing, Michigan.</p>
    <p>I am attending BYU-Idaho to receive my Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology as part of the Pathways Program. I
        currently work for the State of Michigan and am taking classes to learn about programming to help make my job
        more efficient. </p>
